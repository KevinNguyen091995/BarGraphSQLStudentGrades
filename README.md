# BarGraphSQLStudentGrades

This project will query SQL data in a remote SQL server. This will average a student grades and create a bar graph corresponding to how many students received D,C,B,A in a teacher's class.

Images of the DB and bar chart included. 

NOTE:
The current list to add grades to hashmap is not dynamic. This will be improved on in the future.
